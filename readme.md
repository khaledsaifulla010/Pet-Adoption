### Short Description of The Project

This is a "Pet Adoption" website design that leverages Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic features. The site includes several sections to help users find pets to adopt, with options to filter by categories, sort by price, and interact with adoption modals for further details.

The homepage features a banner introducing the pet adoption service, followed by dynamic category buttons that allow users to explore different types of pets, such as dogs or cats. Each pet card displays the pet’s image, price, and a brief description, with an "Adopt Now" button that triggers a modal providing more details about the adoption process.

The website also allows users to sort pets by price (ascending or descending), offering a user-friendly way to filter listings. Additionally, there’s a modal window that pops up when users click on specific pets, showing more in-depth details such as age, breed, and a description of the pet.

The clean and responsive design ensures that the site is accessible across devices, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience for those looking to adopt a pet.
